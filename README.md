# Codex
CODEX is a self-study tool that encourages you to read more code. The platform enables you to create scheduled "servings" of high quality code direct from Github based on the language and topic of your  choice. Timely notifications are delivered via SMS message or email utilizing the Twilio and SendGrid APIs.
